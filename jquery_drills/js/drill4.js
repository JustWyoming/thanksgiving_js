//$('.stage').find('div').first().hide());
//break;
// }
// for each subsequent case, don't forget you can dial down the div very specifically:
//('.stage div#second').delay(5000).fiadeOut();
//.eq() is equal to a specifc location in an array or list, for example

//play with this in console for interactivity to really understand what you're working with
//and where it's located.
